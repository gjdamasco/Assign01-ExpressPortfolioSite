         <p> One of my Javascript assignment from client side web development course. 
            It shows how the Document Object Model (DOM) represents the page so that programs can change the structure, style and content. </p>

         <p> Final project from my web interface design course. This is to show how the css and html5 work together so that style can be added to the website. 
            CSS is linked to html browser adding personal style to the body of the website. </p>

      <div class="clearfix">
         <img src="/assets/images/03proj.jpg" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="03proj" >
         <p> My first homepage that I did when I started my web interface design course. 
            I used html5 alone and textpad as an editor. There was no css yet attached to the website. 
            Body styles were coded inside the header section.   </p>
